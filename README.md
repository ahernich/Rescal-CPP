# rescal_als.h

C++ implementation of RESCAL-ALS, an algorithm for learning a latent feature representation of a knowledge graph. This implementation is a translation of the [original Python implementation](https://github.com/mnick/rescal.py) by Maximilian Nickel.

## Installation

To install, simply copy rescal_als.h where your compiler can find it. 
rescal_als.h depends on the following C++ libraries:

* [Eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org)
* [Spectra](https://github.com/yixuan/spectra)

RESCAL-ALS expects a knowledge graph to be represented as a tensor. 
For the purposes of RESCAL-ALS, 
we can think of a tensor as a sequence X[1],X[2],... of matrices, 
all with the same number of rows and columns. 
The matrix X[k] is called the k-th slice of the tensor. 
If the knowledge graph has n entities and m relations,
then the tensor has m slices of dimension n x n, one for each relation. 
The k-th slice X[k] is the adjacency matrix of the k-th relation. 
Thus, X[k][i,j] = 1 if entity i is related to entity j in relation k, 
and X[k][i,j] = 0 otherwise.

Given the tensor representation X[1],...,X[m] 
of a knowledge graph with n entities and an integer r, 
RESCAL-ALS computes an n x r matrix A and r x r matrices R[1],...,R[m]
such that X[k] is approximated well by A R[k] A^T.

The matrix A represents the entities of the knowledge graph
in terms of r latent features, 
whereas R[k] represents the relationships between these features 
with respect to relation k.
   
## Usage

All functionality is provided through the class Rescal::ALS. 
The following example runs RESCAL-ALS 
on the tensor representation X[1],...,X[m] of a knowledge graph
and outputs the factor matrices A and R[k],
along with the approximations A R[k] A^T of the matrix X[k]:
```c++
#include <rescal_als.h>
#include <iostream>

using namespace Rescal;

int main()
{
    // Prepare input tensor X for knowledge graph with n entities and m relations
    // (SparseMatrix is imported from Eigen)

    SparseMatrix<double> X1(n, n);
    ...

    ...

    SparseMatrix<double> Xm(n, n);
    ...

    Tensor<double> X {X1, ..., Xm};

    // Run RESCAL-ALS to learn a representation of the knowledge graph in terms
    // of r latent features. More precisely, run RESCAL-ALS to factor X into a 
    // matrix A and matrices R[0], ..., R[m-1], where A has dimension n x r and 
    // the R[i] have dimension r x r.
    ALS<double> als(X, r);
    als.compute();

    // Retrieve result
    const Matrix<double>& A = als.getA();
    const std::vector<Matrix<double>>& R = als.getRs();

    std::cout << "Factor matrix A:\n" << A << "\n\n";
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) 
    {
        std::cout << "Factor matrix R[" << i << "]:\n" << R[i] << "\n\n";
        std::cout << "A*R*A^T = \n" << (A * R[i] * A.transpose()) << "\n\n";
    }

    return 0;
}
```
After constructing the tensor representation X of the knowledge graph,
we instantiate Rescal::ALS 
by providing X and the number r of latent features to learn. 
Then, we call the method Rescal::ALS::compute() to run RESCAL-ALS on X.
The method has several parameters to fine-tune RESCAL-ALS,
including parameters for the maximum number of iterations
and the initialization method for the factor matrix A. 
See the documentation of Rescal::ALS::compute() for the default values.
