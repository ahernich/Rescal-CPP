/**
 * This class implements the RESCAL-ALS algorithm for learning a latent feature
 * representation of a knowledge graph.
 *
 * RESCAL-ALS expects a knowledge graph to be given as the sequence of the 
 * adjacency matrices of its relations. More precisely, assume that the 
 * knowledge graph contains entitites \f$E_1,\ldots,E_n\f$ and relations 
 * \f$R_1,\ldots,R_m\f$. We then represent each relation \f$R_i\f$ by its 
 * adjacency matrix \f$X_i\f$, that is, as an \f$n \times n\f$ matrix whose 
 * entry in row \f$r\f$ and column \f$c\f$ is 1 if the knowledge graph contains
 * a \f$R_i\f$-labeled edge from \f$E_r\f$ to \f$E_c\f$, and 0 otherwise. The 
 * matrices \f$X_1,\ldots,X_m\f$ form a tensor. The datatype for representing 
 * tensors is Tensor. 
 *
 * For a detailed description of RESCAL-ALS and its applications, see:

 * The following example illustrates how to use ALS:
 * \code
 * arma::sp_mat X1(n, n);
 * // Initialize X1
 *
 * // ...
 *
 * arma::sp_mat Xm(n, n);
 * // Initialize Xm
 *
 * Tensor X {X1, ..., Xm};
 *
 * // Run RESCAL-ALS to learn a representation of the knowledge graph in terms
 * // of r latent features. More precisely, run RESCAL-ALS to factor X into a 
 * // matrix A and matrices R[0], ..., R[m-1], where A has dimension n x r and 
 * // the R[i] have dimension r x r.
 * ALS als(X, r);
 * als.compute();
 *
 * // Retrieve result
 * const arma::mat& A = als.getA();
 * const std::vector<arma::mat>& Rs = als.getRs();
 *
 * std::cout << "Factor matrix A:\n" << A << "\n\n";
 * for (int i = 0; i != m; ++i) 
 * {
 *   std::cout << "Factor matrix R[" << i << "]:\n" << Rs[i] << "\n\n";
 *   std::cout << "A*R*A^T = \n" << (A * Rs[i] * A.t()) << "\n\n";
 * }
 * \endcode 
 *
 * The main function, compute(), has several parameters to fine-tune RESCAL-ALS,
 * including parameters for the maximum number of iterations and the method of
 * initializing the factor matrix A. See the documentation of compute() for 
 * details.

     * This method factors the input tensor into a matrix \f$A\f$, representing
     * the entities in terms of latent features, and matrices \f$R_i\f$ (one
     * for each relation), representing relationships between latent features 
     * with respect to relation \f$i\f$. The goal is that the \f$i\f$th slice
     * of the input tensor is approximated well by the matrix product
     * \f[
     *     A R_i A^T.
     * \f]
     * The matrices \f$A\f$ and \f$R_i\f$ can be obtained using getA() and

     *   - The method of initializing the factor matrix \f$A\f$. The default is 
     *     InitMethod::NVECS. Use setFactorMatrixInitMethod() to set the method
     *     used by the next call to compute().
     *
     *   - The maximum number of iterations. The default value is 500. Use 
     *     setMaxIterations() to set the maximum number of iterations used by 
     *     the next call to compute().
     *
     *   - The method of computing the fit value (a measure of how well the 
     *     current tensor factorization approximates the input tensor) after 
     *     each iteration. The default is to compute an exact fit value based
     *     on the \f$\ell2\f$ distance between the input tensor and the tensor 
     *     with slices \f$A R_i A^T\f$. For large inputs, it is recommended 
     *     to use an approximation of this fit value or turn off computation
     *     of fit values entirely. Use enableExactFitComputation(),

     *     the method used by the next call to compute().
